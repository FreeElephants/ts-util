# Typescript Util Package

It's home-project for:
1. Learn Java Collection Framework (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/collections/index.html) and standard data structures (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html).
2. My be port it as far as possible to TypeScript. I'm not found good solution with data structures for TypeScript. I know about https://github.com/basarat/typescript-collections, but I'm like Java syntax more.
3. Try to use my xUnit framework for TypeScript (https://github.com/FreeElephants/TSxUnit)
4. Get practice with TypeScript / npm.
